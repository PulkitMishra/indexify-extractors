# Whisper Diarization Extractor
This extractor uses Whisper ASR and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to identify the speaker for each sentence in the transcription generated by Whisper.

A given audio file will go through the following steps:

1. Voice Extraction: Isolate voices from background noise to improve the clarity of the speaker's voice.
2. Transcription with Whisper: Use Whisper technology to transcribe the speech, converting audio into text.
3. Timestamp Alignment with WhisperX: Correct and align the timestamps for each spoken word using WhisperX to minimize timing discrepancies.
4. Voice Activity Detection with MarbleNet: Employ MarbleNet to detect active speech segments and remove silences from the audio.
5. Speaker Embedding with TitaNet: Utilize TitaNet to analyze voice characteristics and identify unique speakers in the audio.
6. Speaker Association: Associate the identified speakers with the correct segments and words in the transcription based on the timestamps generated by WhisperX.
7. Time Shift Compensation: Apply punctuation models to adjust for minor time shifts and ensure accurate speaker identification throughout the transcript.
